# ES to Pegasus Theme Converter

A proof of concept tool for converting EmulationStation themes to Pegasus. Highly experimental, beware the dragons.

## Usage

`./convert inputdir [outputdir]`

This will read the ES theme files in `inputdir`, then generate new files in `outpudir`. At the moment, you might want to step into an ES theme's directory and run the script from there.
